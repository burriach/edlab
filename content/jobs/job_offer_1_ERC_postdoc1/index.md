**OPEN POSITION: POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER FOR STOIKOS (apply from 17/03/2023 to 9/04/2023)**
<!--more-->
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher for the STOIKOS project (Elemental ecology: towards an element-based functional ecology, reference: ERC-2022-STG 101076740-STOIKOS) funded by the European Research Council.

The project aims to investigate whether the elemental composition of organisms relates to ecosystem functioning, and whether ecosystem elemental diversity predicts ecosystem functioning better than traditional metrics of diversity. The candidate will join a multidisciplinary team, working with observations, experiments and theoretical modelling to answer our scientific questions. The candidate will benefit from the training and career development opportunities offered through our research team and CREAF, exposure to international research and interaction with other national and international collaborators.

A full-time contract is offered, for 24 months, starting on May 1st, 2023 (start date negotiable). The gross salary offered is ~€30k€ annually (plus seniority).
