abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global health, with
  millions of people affected by the disease. Recent studies have shown that environmental
  factors such as air quality, temperature, and humidity can impact the survival and
  transmission of the virus, leading to differences in the rate of spread and severity
  of the disease in different regions. In this global cross-sectional study, we analyzed
  the relationship between environmental factors and the transmission and survival
  of the virus in 167 cities distributed all over the world. We used a dataset containing
  daily COVID-19 data for 167 cities from 01/05/2020 to 01/01/2022, along with variables
  related to atmospheric and environmental conditions. We found an expected positive
  relationship between increases in atmospheric NO 2 concentration and increases in
  the infective rate of COVID-19. We also found an unexpected negative relationship
  between PM10 and COVID-19 spread, which was stronger in unpolluted cities, and indicating
  a likely stronger and faster deactivation of the viruses by the absorption to the
  larger than to the smaller particles, to PM10 more than to PM2.5. Although a complete
  analysis would require taking into account the restrictions in the city and the
  immunization status of the population, and the variance of COVID-19 spread explained
  by PM10 was small, only up to approx. 2%, these results contribute to a better understanding
  of the impact of particles on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viral
  diseases thus informing public health policies and interventions aimed at mitigating
  the impact of these pandemics.
