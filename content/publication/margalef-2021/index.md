abstract: Soil phosphatase enzymes are produced by plant roots and microorganisms
  and play a key role in the cycling of phosphorus (P), an often-limiting element
  in terrestrial ecosystems. The production of these enzymes in soil is the most important
  biological strategy for acquiring phosphate ions from organic molecules. Previous
  works showed how soil potential phosphatase activity is mainly driven by climatic
  conditions and soil nitrogen (N) and carbon. Nonetheless, future trends of the activity
  of these enzymes under global change remain little known. We investigated the influence
  of some of the main drivers of change on soil phosphatase activity using a meta-analysis
  of results from 97 published studies. Our database included a compilation of N and
  P fertilization experiments, manipulation experiments with increased atmospheric
  CO2 concentration, warming, and drought, and studies comparing invaded and non-invaded
  ecosystems. Our results indicate that N fertilization leads to higher phosphatase
  activity, whereas P fertilization has the opposite effect. The rise of atmospheric
  CO2 levels or the arrival of invasive species also exhibits positive response ratios
  on the activity of soil phosphatases. However, the occurrence of recurrent drought
  episodes decreases the activity of soil phosphatases. Our analysis did not reveal
  statistically significant effects of warming on soil phosphatase activity. In general,
  soil enzymatic changes in the reviewed experiments depended on the initial nutrient
  and water status of the ecosystems. The observed patterns evidence that future soil
  phosphatase activity will not only depend on present-day soil conditions but also
  on potential compensations or amplifications among the different drivers of global
  change. The responses of soil phosphatases to the global change drivers reported
  in this study and the consideration of cost–benefit approaches based on the connection
  of the P and N cycle will be useful for a better estimation of phosphatase production
  in carbon (C)–N–P models.
