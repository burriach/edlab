abstract: Anthropogenic activities and intensive farming are causing nitrate pollution
  in groundwater bodies. These aquifers are drained by springs which, in the Mediterranean
  region, act as refugia for preserving biodiversity of species that need continuous
  water. Some springs are also used for drinking water for wild animals, livestock
  and humans, so if their water quality is compromised it can become a threat to public
  health. However, the impact of nitrate pollution on these biotic communities remains
  unknown. We sampled 338 assemblages of aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophytes (i.e.,
  hygrophytic mosses and liverworts) growing in springs in a gradient of water conductivity,
  nitrate concentration and climate and distributed across the north-east of the Iberian
  Peninsula to investigate the impact of nitrate pollution on the diversity of bryophytes
  and moss functional traits in Mediterranean springs. Based on previous literature
  suggesting that increased nitrogen load decreases biodiversity in grasslands and
  freshwater ecosystems, we hypothesised that water nitrate pollution in springs decreases
  bryophyte diversity at the local and regional scales. Our results indicated that,
  at the local scale (spring), nitrate pollution reduced the number and the likelihood
  of finding a rare species in springs. Rare species were found in 4% of the springs
  with nitrate above 50 mg L−1 but in 32% of the springs with nitrate below 50 mg
  L−1. Moss, liverwort and overall bryophyte diversity were not directly affected
  by nitrate at the local scale but nitrate consistently decreased diversity of mosses,
  liverworts and rare bryophyte species at the regional scale. We also found that
  warmer and drier springs presented fewer bryophyte species. Our results show that
  the combination of nitrate pollution, increasing temperature and drought could severely
  threaten bryophyte diversity in Mediterranean springs. Our results indicate that
  the absence of rare bryophytes could be used as a bioindicator of nitrate pollution
  in springs.
