abstract: Climate change is increasing temperatures globally and drought in many regions.
  If climate change continues at its current rate, the resilience of many ecosystems
  will likely be exceeded, altering their structure and function. A consistent understanding
  of the impacts, however, remains elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining data
  of field studies at different scales from local to regional. We review the impacts
  of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems of the Mediterranean region based mostly
  on long-term field experiments of climatic manipulation and monitored field sites
  in Catalonia (NE Spain). These studies provide diverse experimental and observational
  field evidences that rising temperatures, new patterns of precipitation and other
  climatic changes are already affecting ecosystems in this Mediterranean region.
  Rapid genetic, epigenetic and metabolomics changes in plants have been described.
  They have resulted in changes in morphology, physiology, growth, reproduction, and
  mortality. Some species are more vulnerable to these changes than others are, which
  has altered their competitive ability and thereby changed microbial, plant and animal
  community composition. Many other impacts have been observed in response to climate
  change, for example an increase in the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds
  or an increased risk of fire and a decrease in the absorption of CO2 in periods
  of drought. A reduction of the capacity to retain nutrients and C in vegetation
  is accompanied, in the short term, by an increase in soil C and nutrient contents
  due to a decrease in the enzymatic capacity and mineralization of soil. The projected
  increase of torrential rainfalls introduces a scenario of uncertain changes in nutrient
  cycles, soil fertility and nutrient fluxes at medium and long terms. All these changes
  in water and nutrient availability suggest, though, net losses in the capacity of
  Mediterranean forests and shrublands to act as C sinks. Future research should quantify
  C in above- and belowground biomasses and soils under drought and warming, because
  this necessary information is lacking. Future studies should also investigate the
  losses of soil nutrients by leaching and erosion, and the possible feedbacks of
  land cover changes on water availability and regional climate. Policies of environmental
  and forestry management should take into account these impacts of the environmental
  and climatic conditions projected for the coming years and decades.
