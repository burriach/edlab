abstract: Differences in the elemental composition of plants, mainly C, N, and P,
  have been shown to be related to differences in their nutritional status, and their
  morphological and functional traits. The relationship between morphological traits
  and micronutrients and trace elements, however, has been much less studied. Additionally,
  in bryophytes, research devoted to investigating these relationships is still very
  scarce. Here, we analysed 80 samples from 29 aquatic and semi-aquatic (hygrophytic)
  moss species living in Mediterranean springs to investigate the relationship between
  moss nutrient concentrations and their micro- and macroscopic morphological traits
  and growth forms. We found that, across species, the elemental concentration of
  mosses was more tightly linked to macroscopic traits than to microscopic traits.
  Growth forms could also be successfully explained by the concentration of elements
  in mosses. Apart from macronutrients and their stoichiometric ratios (C:N, C:P,
  and N:P), micronutrients and trace elements were also important variables predicting
  moss morphological traits and growth forms. Additionally, our results showed that
  microscopic traits were well related to macroscopic traits. Overall, our results
  clearly indicate that the elemental composition of mosses can be used to infer their
  morphological traits, and that elements other than macronutrients should be taken
  into account to achieve a good representation of their morphological and, potentially,
  functional traits when comparing the elemental composition across species.
