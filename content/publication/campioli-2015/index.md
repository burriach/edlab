abstract: Plants acquire carbon through photosynthesis to sustain biomass production,
  autotrophic respiration and production of non-structural compounds for multiple
  purposes. The fraction of photosynthetic production used for biomass production,
  the biomass production efficiency, is a key determinant of the conversion of solar
  energy to biomass. In forest ecosystems, biomass production efficiency was suggested
  to be related to site fertility. Here we present a database of biomass production
  efficiency from 131 sites compiled from individual studies using harvest, biometric,
  eddy covariance, or process-based model estimates of production. The database is
  global, but dominated by data from Europe and North America. We show that instead
  of site fertility, ecosystem management is the key factor that controls biomass
  production efficiency in terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, in natural forests,
  grasslands, tundra, boreal peatlands and marshes, biomass production efficiency
  is independent of vegetation, environmental and climatic drivers. This similarity
  of biomass production efficiency across natural ecosystem types suggests that the
  ratio of biomass production to gross primary productivity is constant across natural
  ecosystems. We suggest that plant adaptation results in similar growth efficiency
  in high- and low-fertility natural systems, but that nutrient influxes under managed
  conditions favour a shift to carbon investment from the belowground flux of non-structural
  compounds to aboveground biomass.
