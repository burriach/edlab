abstract: The leaf economics spectrum 1,2 and the global spectrum of plant forms and
  functions 3 revealed fundamental axes of variation in plant traits, which represent
  different ecological strategies that are shaped by the evolutionary development
  of plant species 2 . Ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and
  the traits of species that comprise the ecological communities 4 . However, the
  axes of variation of ecosystem functions are largely unknown, which limits our understanding
  of how ecosystems respond as a whole to anthropogenic drivers, climate and environmental
  variability 4,5 . Here we derive a set of ecosystem functions 6 from a dataset of
  surface gas exchange measurements across major terrestrial biomes. We find that
  most of the variability within ecosystem functions (71.8%) is captured by three
  key axes. The first axis reflects maximum ecosystem productivity and is mostly explained
  by vegetation structure. The second axis reflects ecosystem water-use strategies
  and is jointly explained by variation in vegetation height and climate. The third
  axis, which represents ecosystem carbon-use efficiency, features a gradient related
  to aridity, and is explained primarily by variation in vegetation structure. We
  show that two state-of-the-art land surface models reproduce the first and most
  important axis of ecosystem functions. However, the models tend to simulate more
  strongly correlated functions than those observed, which limits their ability to
  accurately predict the full range of responses to environmental changes in carbon,
  water and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems 7,8 .
