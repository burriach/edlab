abstract: Fungi are key decomposers of deadwood, but the impact of anthropogenic changes
  in nutrients and temperature on fungal community and its consequences for wood microbial
  respiration are not well understood. Here, we examined how nitrogen and phosphorus
  additions (field experiment) and warming (laboratory experiment) together influence
  fungal composition and microbial respiration from decomposing wood of angiosperms
  and gymnosperms in a subtropical forest. Nutrient additions significantly increased
  wood microbial respiration via fungal composition, but effects varied with nutrient
  types and taxonomic groups. Specifically, phosphorus addition significantly increased
  wood microbial respiration (65%) through decreased acid phosphatase activity and
  increased abundance of fast‐decaying fungi (e.g., white rot), while nitrogen addition
  marginally increased it (30%). Phosphorus addition caused a greater increase in
  microbial respiration in gymnosperms than in angiosperms (83.3% vs. 46.9%), which
  was associated with an increase in Basidiomycota:Ascomycota operational taxonomic
  unit abundance in gymnosperms but a decrease in angiosperms. The temperature dependencies
  of microbial respiration were remarkably constant across nutrient levels, consistent
  with metabolic scaling theory hypotheses. This is because there was no significant
  interaction between temperature and wood phosphorus availability or fungal composition,
  or the interaction among the three factors. Our results highlight the key role of
  tree identity in regulating nutrient response of wood microbial respiration through
  controlling fungal composition. Given that the range of angiosperm species may expand
  under climate warming and forest management, our data suggest that expansion will
  decrease nutrient effects on forest carbon cycling in forests previously dominated
  by gymnosperm species.
