abstract: Global vegetation photosynthesis and productivity have increased substantially
  since the 1980s, but this trend is heterogeneous in both time and space. Here, we
  categorize the secular trend in global vegetation greenness into sustained greening,
  sustained browning and greening-to-browning. We found that by 2016, increased global
  vegetation greenness had begun to level off, with the area of browning increasing
  in the last decade, reaching 39.0 million km2 (35.9% of the world's vegetated area).
  This area is larger than the area with sustained increasing growth (27.8 million
  km2, 26.4%); thus, 12.0% ± 3.1% (0.019 ± 0.004 NDVI a−1) of the previous earlier
  increase has been offset since 2010 (2010–2016, P < 0.05). Global gross primary
  production also leveled off, following the trend in vegetation greenness in time
  and space. This leveling off was caused by increasing soil water limitations due
  to the spatial expansion of drought, whose impact dominated over the impacts of
  temperature and solar radiation. This response of global gross primary production
  to soil water limitation was not identified by land submodels within Earth system
  models. Our results provide empirical evidence that global vegetation greenness
  and primary production are offset by water stress and suggest that as global warming
  continues, land submodels may overestimate the world's capacity to take up carbon
  with global vegetation greening.
