abstract: The Mediterranean is among the regions predicted to be most affected by
  climate change due to rising temperatures and increasing frequency as well as intensity
  of extreme weather events, such as drought. These shifts in climatic conditions
  might lead to changes in species community composition by enabling the increase
  of drought-tolerant species at the expense of less tolerant ones. This hypothesis
  was tested in the current study using chlorophyll fluorescence data from a 21-year
  precipitation exclusion experiment in a Mediterranean forest for two co-dominant
  Quercus ilex and Phillyrea latifolia species with contrasting low and high levels
  of drought tolerance, respectively. The maximum potential quantum efficiency of
  photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), photochemical efficiency of PSII (yield), and non-photochemical
  quenching (NPQ) varied seasonally. Fv/Fm and NPQ levels were positively correlated
  with air temperature and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI),
  whereas yield, which was greater under drought treatment was negatively associated
  with vapor pressure deficit and SPEI. Fv/Fm values showed similar increase in the
  two species over the 21-year study period regardless of treatment and in parallel
  to progressive warming. In contrast, yield values were higher in Q. ilex than in
  P. latifolia, while NPQ values were higher in P. latifolia than in Q. ilex. Notably,
  high yield values were also observed in the drought treated plots. Throughout the
  study, plants in the drought treated plots exhibited decreased basal area, leaf
  biomass, and aerial cover due to high stem mortality. In addition, a continuous
  increase in temperature was detected in summer and autumn, which might explain the
  observed increase in Fv/Fm values over the study period. Higher yield and lower
  NPQ detected in Q. ilex could be attributed to less competition for resources in
  the drought treated plots and acclimation of Q. ilex plants over the study period.
  Our results indicate that reduction in stem density could improve forest resilience
  to climate change-induced drought conditions.
