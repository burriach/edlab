abstract: Grasslands are key repositories of biodiversity and carbon storage and are
  heavily impacted by effects of global warming and changes in precipitation regimes.
  Patterns of grassland dynamics associated with variability in future climate conditions
  across spatiotemporal scales are yet to be adequately quantified. Here, we performed
  a global meta‐analysis of year and growing season sensitivities of vegetation aboveground
  biomass (AGB), aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), and species richness
  (SR) and diversity (Shannon index, H) to experimental climate warming and precipitation
  shifts. All four variables were sensitive to climate change. Their sensitivities
  to shifts in precipitation were correlated with local background water availability,
  such as mean annual precipitation (MAP) and aridity, and AGB and ANPP sensitivities
  were greater in dry habitats than in non‐water limited habitats. There was no effect
  of duration of experiment (short vs long‐term) on sensitivities. Temporal trends
  in ANPP and SR sensitivity depended on local water availability; ANPP sensitivity
  to warming increased over time and SR sensitivity to irrigation decreased over time.
  Our results provide a global overview of the sensitivities of grassland function
  and diversity to climate change that will improve understanding of ecological responses
  across spatiotemporal scales and inform policies for conservation in dry climates.
