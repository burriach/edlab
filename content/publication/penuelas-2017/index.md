abstract: The increase in aridity, mainly by decreases in precipitation but also by
  higher temperatures, is likely the main threat to the diversity and survival of
  Mediterranean forests. Changes in land use, including the abandonment of extensive
  crop activities, mainly in mountains and remote areas, and the increases in human
  settlements and demand for more resources with the resulting fragmentation of the
  landscape, hinder the establishment of appropriate management tools to protect Mediterranean
  forests and their provision of services and biodiversity. Experiments and observations
  indicate that if changes in climate, land use and other components of global change,
  such as pollution and overexploitation of resources, continue, the resilience of
  many forests will likely be exceeded, altering their structure and function and
  changing, mostly decreasing, their capacity to continue to provide their current
  services. A consistent assessment of the impacts of the changes, however, remains
  elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining simultaneous and complete data for all
  scales of the impacts in the same forests, areas and regions. We review the impacts
  of climate change and other components of global change and their interactions on
  the terrestrial forests of Mediterranean regions, with special attention to their
  impacts on ecosystem services. Management tools for counteracting the negative effects
  of global change on Mediterranean ecosystem- services are finally discussed.
