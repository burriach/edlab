abstract: We present a global analysis of the relationship of forest production efficiency
  (FPE) to stand age and climate, based on a large compilation of data on gross primary
  production and either biomass production or net primary production. FPE is important
  for both forest production and atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake. Earlier findings
  - FPE declining with age - are supported by this analysis. However, FPE also increases
  with absolute latitude, precipitation and (all else equal) with temperature. The
  temperature effect is opposite to what would be expected based on the short-term
  physiological response of respiration rates to temperature. It implies top-down
  regulation of forest carbon loss, perhaps reflecting the higher carbon costs of
  nutrient acquisition in colder climates. Current ecosystem models do not reproduce
  this phenomenon. They consistently predict lower FPE in warmer climates, and are
  therefore likely to overestimate carbon losses in a warming climate.
