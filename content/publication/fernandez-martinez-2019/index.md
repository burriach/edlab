abstract: Mast seeding is one of the most intriguing reproductive traits in nature.
  Despite its potential drawbacks in terms of fitness, the widespread existence of
  this phenomenon suggests that it should have evolutionary advantages under certain
  circumstances. Using a global dataset of seed production time series for 219 plant
  species from all of the continents, we tested whether masting behaviour appears
  predominantly in species with low foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations,
  when controlling for local climate and productivity. Here, we show that masting
  intensity is higher in species with low foliar N and P concentrations, and especially
  in those with imbalanced N:P ratios, and that the evolutionary history of masting
  behaviour has been linked to that of nutrient economy. Our results support the hypothesis
  that masting is stronger in species growing under limiting conditions and suggest
  that this reproductive behaviour might have evolved as an adaptation to nutrient
  limitations and imbalances.
