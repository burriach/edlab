abstract: Semi-natural springs contain complex com- munities of living organisms that
  look for constant water supplies. However, an ex- cess of nitrate in the underlying
  aquifers could affect species richness, especially of those groups that are sensitive
  to pol- lution such as bryophytes (mosses and liv- erworts). In this study, we analyse
  water characteristics and presence of bryophytes in 93 natural springs in Lluçanès
  region. We find that although a few species can cope with a relative nitrate excess,
  most of them do not tolerate it, meaning that spe- cies richness decreases in the
  most polluted sources, showing an adverse effect of water pollution on the biodiversity
  of bryophytes.
