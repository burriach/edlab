abstract: Key message Stand age, water availability, and the length of the warm period
  are the most influencing controls of forest structure, functioning, and efficiency.
  Abstract We aimed to discern the distribution and controls of plant biomass, carbon
  fluxes, and resource-use efficiencies of forest ecosystems ranging from boreal to
  tropical forests. We analysed a global forest database containing estimates of stand
  biomass and carbon fluxes (400 and 111 sites, respectively) from which we calculated
  resource-use efficiencies (biomass production, carbon sequestration, light, and
  water-use efficiencies). We used the WorldClim climatic database and remote-sensing
  data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro- radiometer to analyse
  climatic controls of ecosystem
