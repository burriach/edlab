abstract: Mediterranean spring ecosystems are unique habitats at the interface between
  surface water and groundwater. These ecosystems support a remarkable array of biodiversity
  and provide important ecological functions and ecosystem services. Spring ecosystems
  are influenced by abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic factors such as the lithology
  of their draining aquifers, their climate, and the land use of their recharge area,
  all of which affect the water chemistry of the aquifer and the spring discharges.
  One of the most relevant characteristics of spring ecosystems is the temporal stability
  of environmental conditions, including physicochemical features of the spring water,
  across seasons and years. This stability allows a wide range of species to benefit
  from these ecosystems (particularly during dry periods), fostering an unusually
  high number of endemic species. However, global change poses important threats to
  these freshwater ecosystems. Changes in temperature, evapotranspiration, and precipitation
  patterns can alter the water balance and chemistry of spring water. Eutrophication
  due to agricultural practices and emergent pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals,
  personal care products, and pesticides, is also a growing concern for the preservation
  of spring biodiversity. Here, we provide a synthesis of the main characteristics
  and functioning of Mediterranean spring ecosystems. We then describe their ecological
  value and biodiversity patterns and highlight the main risks these ecosystems face.
  Moreover, we identify existing knowledge gaps to guide future research in order
  to fully uncover the hidden biodiversity within these habitats and understand the
  main drivers that govern them. Finally, we provide a brief summary of recommended
  actions that should be taken to effectively manage and preserve Mediterranean spring
  ecosystems for future generations. Even though studies on Mediterranean spring ecosystems
  are still scarce, our review shows there are sufficient data to conclude that their
  future viability as functional ecosystems is under severe threat.
