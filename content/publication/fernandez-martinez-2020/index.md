abstract: Global change is affecting terrestrial carbon (C) balances. The effect of
  climate on ecosystem C balance has been largely explored, but the roles of other
  concurrently changing factors, such as diversity and nutrient availability, remain
  elusive. We used eddy-covariance C-flux measurements from 62 ecosystems from which
  we compiled information on climate, ecosystem type, stand age, species abundance
  and foliar concentrations of N and P of the main species, to assess their importance
  in the ecosystem C balance. Climate and productivity were the main determinants
  of ecosystem C balance and its stability. In P-rich sites, increasing N was related
  to increased gross primary production and respiration and vice versa, but reduced
  net C uptake. Our analyses did not provide evidence for a strong relation between
  ecosystem diversity and their productivity and stability. Nonetheless, these results
  suggest that nutrient imbalances and, potentially, diversity loss may alter future
  global C balance.
