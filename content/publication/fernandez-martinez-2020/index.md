abstract: In his recent communication on our original paper 1,2 , D. Kelly, claiming
  that nutrient scarcity cannot select for masting behaviour in plants, initiated
  a fruitful discussion on traditionally settled hypotheses about the evolution of
  reproductive behaviour in plants. In his commentary, Kelly raises support for a
  contrasting hypothesis explaining our observation that temporally variable seed
  production is more pronounced under nutrient scarcity, namely that nutrient scarcity
  does not directly cause seed production variability but instead increases variability
  induced by economies of scale (EOS). The commentary hinges mainly on the argument
  that an EOS is necessary to select for highly variable seed production. It also
  points out that there are no mechanisms by which nutrient scarcity would select
  for that particular trait over generations. In reply to the stimulating comment,
  we (1) propose a mechanism by which nutrient scarcity may select for highly variable
  seed production, with weather patterns inducing masting synchrony across populations;
  and (2) further discuss why wind pollination and predator satiation, the EOS suggested
  by Kelly, cannot be the only selective pressures that select for highly variable
  reproduction. There is robust empirical evidence 3,4 showing that nutrient scarcity
  and climate, are long-existing evolutionary forces that have selected for multiple
  plant traits and have constrained the physiology of plants since their early development.
  Limiting resources, such as water and nutrients, thus trigger the evolution of conservative
  traits for those limiting factors 4. Logically, nutrient availability is a direct
  determinant of the mean fruit production in agriculture and in the wild 5. In our
  paper 1 , we hypothesized that low nutrient availability is also an important factor
  selecting for highly variable and synchronized seed production, the latter in combination
  with adaptation to variability in long-term climate patterns. Our hypothesis as
  to why nutrient scarcity may have selected for highly variable seed production in
  nutrient-poor plants, probably not entirely explained in our original paper, was
  based on a mechanism linking highly variable seed production in nutrient-poor plant
  species to increased interspecific and intraspecific competitiveness. Because fruits
  are nutrient-enriched tissues 6 , their production under low fertility implies a
  reduced allocation of nutrients to growth and defence 7 , and therefore lower competitiveness
  and survival for the parent plants. Reductions in plant nutrient concentrations
  after reproduction have been described for several species 8 , in addition to growth
  and defence-reproductive trade-offs 7. Therefore, when nutrients are scarce, losing
  large amounts of nutrients year after year might jeopardize plant growth through
  reduced photosynthesis, a highly nutrient-dependent process 9. Constant yearly reproduction
  would also imply a constant lowering of the availability of nutrients for other
  processes. In contrast, nutrient accumulation in years with suitable weather conditions
  for soil organic matter decomposition and mineralization may provide sufficient
  nutrients to allow a high fruit crop in the following year, which would not come
  at the expense of reduced competitiveness or increased mortality risk (Fig. 1).
  Under these conditions, high temporal variability would thus be beneficial and likely
  to be selected for. In contrast, under nutrient-rich conditions, plants can potentially
  reproduce regularly without jeopardizing their competitiveness ; this is actually
  one of the reasons for fertilizer addition as a long-existing agricultural practice.
  This mechanism, which could have originated during the early evolution of plants,
  may explain why, under low nutrient availability, nutrient-conservative plants with
  highly variable reproduction may have been preferentially selected in comparison
  to nutrient-spending plants (with more constant reproduction). Further research,
  including long-term datasets of reproduction, growth and defence allocation, however,
  is needed to validate our hypotheses. For a population to exhibit highly variable
  reproduction over time, a strong synchrony among individuals is required 10. Synchronous
  seed production is another important feature of masting behaviour that has been
  traditionally associated with the benefits of EOS, as it has been suggested to be
  an adaptive response to improve pollination efficiency or escape seed preda-tion
  8. Synchrony among individuals in a plant population is the rule rather than the
  exception, as for example in leaf flushing, flower blooming, die-back episodes or
  simply growth as shown by dendrochronology studies. The most likely mechanism driving
  the synchrony in phenology, growth or reproduction is the similar response of a
  population to changing weather patterns, by affecting metabolism and plant resources.
