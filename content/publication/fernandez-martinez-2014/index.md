abstract: Forests strongly affect climate through the exchange of large amounts of
  atmospheric CO2 (ref. 1). The main drivers of spatial variability in net ecosystem
  production (NEP) on a global scale are, however, poorly known. As increasing nutrient
  availability increases the production of biomass per unit of photosynthesis2 and
  reduces heterotrophic3 respiration in forests, we expected nutrients to determine
  carbon sequestration in forests. Our synthesis study of 92 forests in different
  climate zones revealed that nutrient availability indeed plays a crucial role in
  determining NEP and ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEe; that is, the ratio of
  NEP to gross primary production (GPP)). Forests with high GPP exhibited high NEP
  only in nutrient-rich forests (CUEe = 33 ± 4%; mean ± s.e.m.). In nutrient-poor
  forests, a much larger proportion of GPP was released through ecosystem respiration,
  resulting in lower CUEe (6 ± 4%). Our finding that nutrient availability exerts
  a stronger control on NEP than on carbon input (GPP) conflicts with assumptions
  of nearly all global coupled carbon cycle–climate models, which assume that carbon
  inputs through photosynthesis drive biomass production and carbon sequestration.
  An improved global understanding of nutrient availability would therefore greatly
  improve carbon cycle modelling and should become a critical focus for future research.
