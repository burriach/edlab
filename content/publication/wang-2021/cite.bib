 abstract = {In the Research Article "Recent global decline of CO fertilization effects on vegetation photosynthesis, " there was a small error in the histogram in Fig. 1B in the main text and in fig. S9B in the supplementary materials caused by a data-processing bug (the x axis started from 0.2, not from zero as labeled), and the calculation of standard deviation (SD) was not fully explained in the figure caption (the caption did not state that the SD was calculated from the data within the range of the y axis). Figure 1B, fig. S9B, and their captions have been corrected accordingly. In the original figure, the authors chose the $β$ range of -10 to 50 because this range is reasonable for CO fertilization effect (CFE) based on the meta-analysis results from free-air CO enrichment (FACE) experiments and on the results from Earth-system models (1). The authors have also prepared another figure in which they have changed the y axis range from [-10, 50] that covers more than 85% of all pixels to a wider range of -20 to 80 that covers more than 94% of all pixels (see fig. S1). The change of range only affects the SDs in Fig. 1 but not the global median that was used throughout the paper. The results and main findings of this article are not affected. The $β$ distributions still differ significantly between 1982-1996 and 2001- 2015 (Fig. 1B), and the global declining trend of $β$ remains significant (Fig. 1A).},
