 abstract = {Springs Project: study of the bryophyte communities of springs Springs are a favourable habitat for the establishment of bryophyte communities due to the constant pres- ence of water. The objective of this project is to identify the bryophyte species that grow in springs, see if there are associations between the different species of bryophytes and check whether their distribution is related to the climate, lithology or the physicochemical characteristics of the water. We have sampled 109 springs in the Montseny and Les Guilleries area and analysed the pH, conductivity and major ions of their water. In addition, we have found an average of 2.6 species of bryophytes per spring. Climate change could lead to the drying up of springs and endanger some of the bryophyte species established in them.},
