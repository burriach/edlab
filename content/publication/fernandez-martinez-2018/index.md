abstract: 'Springs Project: study of the bryophyte communities of springs Springs
  are a favourable habitat for the establishment of bryophyte communities due to the
  constant pres- ence of water. The objective of this project is to identify the bryophyte
  species that grow in springs, see if there are associations between the different
  species of bryophytes and check whether their distribution is related to the climate,
  lithology or the physicochemical characteristics of the water. We have sampled 109
  springs in the Montseny and Les Guilleries area and analysed the pH, conductivity
  and major ions of their water. In addition, we have found an average of 2.6 species
  of bryophytes per spring. Climate change could lead to the drying up of springs
  and endanger some of the bryophyte species established in them.'
