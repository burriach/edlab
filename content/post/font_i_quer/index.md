**Sant Jordi IEC Prizes 2024**

Dr. Fernández-Martínez was awarded the **Pius Font i Quer prize in Life Sciences** as a recognition of his research on elemental ecology. The Font i Quer award, promoted by the Section of Biological Sciences within the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC), is given to early-career scientists as a recognition of their scientific achievements. In this case, the award was granted for Marcos' developments in the field of elemental ecology. These results and innovations will be presented in a seminar next autumn (2024) and compiled in a review article published by IEC, both in Catalan and English languages (2025), under the title: *Diversitat elemental: cap a una ecologia funcional basada en els elements / Elemental diversity: towards an element-based functional ecology*. <br />
