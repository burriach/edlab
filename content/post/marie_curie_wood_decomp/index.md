**Implementing wood decomposition on vegetation models**
<!--more-->
Deadwood occupies 8% of carbon stock in the world's forest and wood decomposition represents ca. 14% of total ecosystem respiration. However, wood decomposition dynamics is overlooked in most vegetation models.<br />
<br />
Do you a good idea on how to include wood decomposition in vegetation models? <br />
<br />
Do you want to help us improve the Three Dimensional - Coupled Model for Carbon Cycle - Forest Ecosystem Module (3D-CMCC-FEM)?<br />
<br />
We are looking for an ecologist or an ecosystem modeller to apply for a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship at either the Institute for Agriculture and Forestry Systems in the Mediterranean (ISAFoM – Perugia, Italy) or Ecological and Forestry Applications Research Cenetre (CREAF, Barcelona, Spain) under the supervision of Drs. **Alessio Collalti** (CNR), **Daniela Dalmonech** (CNR), **Zhenhong Hu** (CREAF) and **Marcos Fernández-Martínez** (CREAF). <br />
