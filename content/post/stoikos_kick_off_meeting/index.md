**Kick-off meeting of the ERC-STOIKOS project**
<!--more-->
Now that the STOIKOS team is complete, we organised the kick-off meeting of the project, having both researchers in-site and researchers connecting remotely. We first introduced the theory behind the project, our main objectives and initial results. Then researchers, postdocs and PhD students presented themselves, their background and their future lines of research within STOIKOS, dealing with subjects spaning from experimental microcosms with bryohpytes, the possibility to bring our theories to agroecosystems, European field campaigns to explore elemental diversity across a wide range of ecosystems, simulations and theoretical modelling of biogeochemical niches, and analyes of global datasets including remote sensing. 

We will be posting our main achievements here and in the project's webpage:
