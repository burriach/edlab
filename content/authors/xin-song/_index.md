bio: Xin Song is a postdoctoral researcher at the EDM team supported by the STOIKOS project since October 2023. During her MSc and Ph.D. studies, her research was primarily focused on the community succession and soil properties after legume introduction on abandoned farmland, mainly about soil organic carbon sequestration, plant succession, and phosphorus limitation. Within the STOIKOS project, she will work on how the elemental composition and diversity in agriculture can help crops improve their yields, stability and other desirable services (e.g., soil carbon sequestration).
