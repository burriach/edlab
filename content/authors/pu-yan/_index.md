Dr. Yan is a post-doctorate researcher interested on understanding how global change affects biodiversity from individual to community levels, and how this ultimately affects ecosystem function and stabilizes or destabilizes ecosystem processes and function. He is currently exploring the impact of functional traits and elemental diversity on ecosystem function and stability.
