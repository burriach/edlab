Zhijing Yu is a PhD student of EDM team supervised by Dr. Marcos Fernández-Martínez. During her MSc studies, her research will be focused on vegetation restoration, soil carbon sequestration, and the regulatory mechanism of mixed forests on soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions and mineralization. Within the STOIKOS project, Zhijing will investigate the relationship between elemental diversity and soil carbon using experiments and global datasets. She will address topics on the increase of SOC and elemental diversity, aiming to identify specific elementomes that are closely associated with SOC. Her goal is to unravel the intrinsic connections between these two factors.
