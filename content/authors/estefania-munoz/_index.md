Estefanía Muñoz is a multidisciplinary researcher focused on understanding and modelling climate-forced ecosystems at several spatio-temporal scales. She has studied problems related to carbon sequestration, soil moisture, plant productivity, evapotranspiration, plant-microbes symbiosis, dengue incidence, and landslides occurrence, among others. Currently, her research is centred on studying the time that carbon spends in terrestrial ecosystems and its drivers under the hypothesis that considering the temporal dimension of carbon sequestration is mandatory to comprehensively understand the role of terrestrial ecosystems in mitigating climate change. She approaches this problem using modelling tools and radiocarbon measurements.
