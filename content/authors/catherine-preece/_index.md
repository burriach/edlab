Her research focuses on how to increase carbon sequestration in agricultural soils. She is a specialist in plant-soil interactions, particularly in response to global change, and the characteristics of roots in wild relatives of crops. She is collaborating with the EDM in the framework of the ERC-StG STOIKOS to study the differences in elemental composition of crop wild relatives and modern crops.
