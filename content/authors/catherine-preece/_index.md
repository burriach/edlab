I am a plant and soil ecologist and my current work focuses on the impact of drought on plant-soil interactions. Recently, I am particularly interested in differences in root and rhizosphere traits between crops and their wild relatives. I also study the feedbacks between plant and soil function and diversity, and the importance of soil communities for ecosystem stability. She is collaborating with the EDM in the framework of the ERC-StG STOIKOS to study the differences in elemental composition of crop wild relatives and modern crops.
