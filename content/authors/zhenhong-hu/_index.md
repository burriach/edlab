Dr. Zhenhong Hu is a Beatriu de Pinós research fellow at the EDM team. His research is focused on plant debris (e.g., deadwood, leaf litter and fine root) decomposition in forest ecosystems, and how the dynamics of these processes will be influenced by global change (e.g., warming, drought and nitrogen and phosphorus deposition), tree species and soil microbial communities. Recently, he explored the diverse wood traits regulating microbial metabolism and nutrient availability in deadwood with the consequences of these trait effects on wood decomposition, carbon fluxes and soil carbon inputs. In the future, he will explore how tree biodiversity controls the elemental composition of organisms (e.g., plant and decomposer), and how elemental diversity drives decomposition rate.
