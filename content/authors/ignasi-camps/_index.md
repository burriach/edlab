Ignasi Camps is a PhD researcher in Non-Linear Dynamics of Biogeochemical Cycles at the EDM team, supervised by Josep Peñuelas and Marcos Fernández, investigating how increasing stress from global change affects ecosystems. With a background in Physics and a Master's degree in Modeling for Science and Engineering, his research takes a multidisciplinary approach, integrating simulations, computational modeling, and data-driven methods to study biogeochemical cycles and complex ecological dynamics. His research interests span ecosystem modeling, biodiversity conservation, and the application of computational simulations to environmental sciences.
