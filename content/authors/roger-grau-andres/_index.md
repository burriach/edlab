# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research has focused on studying how plant communities, soil biota, and ecosystem functioning respond to global change factors and environmental gradients. During my PhD in Glasgow (UK) I studied the effects of fire on plant communities and greenhouse gas exchange in heathlands. Throughout my postdoctoral work in the US and Sweden I studied how altered precipitation regimes or loss of plant functional groups affect plant and soil biota communities and carbon cycling in wetlands and boreal forests. In the STOIKOS project we will investigate how the elemental composition of organisms influence their functional traits, and how elemental diversity drives ecosystem functioning. My main tasks will be to carry out sampling of vegetation and soil biota in Catalonia and throughout Europe, and to carry out laboratory experiments.

Roger Grau-Andrés is a researcher at the EDM team supported by the STOIKOS project since June 2023. His research has focused on studying how plant communities, soil biota, and ecosystem functioning respond to global change factors and environmental gradients. During his PhD in Glasgow (UK) he studied the effects of fire on plant communities and greenhouse gas exchange in heathlands. Throughout his postdoctoral work in the US and Sweden he studied how altered precipitation regimes or loss of plant functional groups affect plant and soil biota communities and carbon cycling in wetlands and boreal forests. Within STOIKOS, he will investigate how the elemental composition of organisms influence their functional traits, and how elemental diversity drives ecosystem functioning.
