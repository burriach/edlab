Eladio Rodríguez-Penedo is a PhD student of the EDM research team supervised by Dr. Marcos Fernández-Martínez. Within the framework of the ERC-STOIKOS project, Eladio will work with the concept of elementomes and elemental diversity with the overall objective of providing a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and species interactions by using experiments and observations, both from the field and from remote sensing.
